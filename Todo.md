## Data Integrations

- Drift 
     - store oracle data to DRIFT/candles/oracle
     - store fill data to DRIFT/candles/fills
     - store raw data to DRIFT/raw/   

- Binance candles (klines) and (kulines)
    - need to clarify the exact difference docs just say that the one is candlestick friendly (maybe holding those invariants)

- Kraken candles 



### Ta-lib integration



### Refactoring:



### Viz_Demo

- Test viz_demo.py
- make instructions for viz-demo 
    - git clone 
    - cp viz demo to your analysis directory 
    - install deps (including qlir)
    - run

we also need to handle the cases where it touches multiple ... e.g. touch lower and touch mid, touch all, or touch mid and upper
