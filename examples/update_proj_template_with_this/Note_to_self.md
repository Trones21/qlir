This project template is becoming quite a monster... and yes maybe some of it can go to a separate lib.

When the project template is stable, i will do all the work of creating all the <file>.py.tpl and update qlir_quickstart.py to write these files (and do the substitutons (e.g. `__PROJECT_NAME__`))

I dont want to continually repeat that work with each update of the template project 

so im just going to copy my "template project" (named afterdata) over (so that my updates are versioned controlled)
