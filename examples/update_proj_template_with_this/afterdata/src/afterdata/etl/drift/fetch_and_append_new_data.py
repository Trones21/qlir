## ToDo:

## Read in existing data

## Does the first available timestamp match the first timestamp in the dataset?

## If not then get and append to front

## Fill any interior gaps

## add new data (up until current final_unix (no partial bars))

## back up existing file (in case of error)

## DQ check on new dataframe

## overwrite file 

## delete backup file
