Parity tests, compare against implementations in TA-lib python: 
https://github.com/TA-Lib/ta-lib-python/blob/master/docs/funcs.md

Value in This:

- No need for reference implementations
- Guard against lookahead bias

Could potentially swap/use for ta-lib when useful, just might take some work to adapt the api contracts.
